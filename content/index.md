###### All My Notes
For the best experience in reading these and all other notes, and also if you wish to EDIT them, do as follows: 
1. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), or another markdown editor.
2. Go to the Github link of this or another note
3. Download all the repo or if you know git just the 'content/' folder
4. Extract just the 'content/' folder from the repo zip file
5. Open Obsidian >> Menage Vaults >> Open Folder as Vault >> and select the 'content/' folder you just extracted

==PLEASE NOTE==:
- These notes were not revised by the professors, so take all of them with a grain of salt.
- However if you download them since they are made in markdown you can EDIT them, please do so.
- If you edit and "upgrade" them, please pass the new ones to the other students and professors.
