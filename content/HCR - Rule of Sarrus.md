Consider a $3 \times 3$ matrix:$$M = \left[\begin{array}{c} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{array}\right]$$Its determinant will be:$$\operatorname{det}(M) = aei + bfg + cdh - ceg - bdi - afh $$In general we can use the '***Rule of Sarrus***' to easily calculate the derminant of any $3 \times 3$ matrix, the rule is as follows:<br>![[Pasted image 20240930225141.png|333]]<br>*Rule of Sarrus*: The determinant of the three columns on the left is the sum of the products along the down-right diagonals minus the sum of the products along the up-right diagonals.
