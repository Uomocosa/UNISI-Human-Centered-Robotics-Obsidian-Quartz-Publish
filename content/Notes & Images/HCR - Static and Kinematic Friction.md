  - Static and Kinematic Friction
---
Each material interaction has 2 friction coefficients:
- One static ($\mu_s$).
- and one kinematic ($\mu_d$),

The static friction coefficient $(\mu_s)$ is used to break the stacity (so when the object is still), while the second one $(\mu_d)$ is used to determine the friction force that slows down the motion.

- ***~Example***:
	- Wood on wood: $\mu_s = 0.25 \sim 0.5$,  $\mu_d = 0.2$
	- Glass on glass: $\mu_s = 0.94$,  $\mu_d = 0.4$
	- Ski on dry snow: $\mu_s \simeq 0$,  $\mu_d = 0.04$
	- When the object is moving and $\mu_s \gg \mu_s$ (usually true) we approximate the static friction coefficient $\mu_s$ to 0, so we do not need to calculate it.
	- Basically when we define the friction cone, the angle is equal to:$$\theta = \tan^{-1}(\mu_s) \kern30px \text{or} \kern30px \theta = \tan^{-1}(\mu_d) $$And it depends if the grasp is static or if the object is sliding in the hand.
