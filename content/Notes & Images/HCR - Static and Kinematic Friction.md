# Static and Kinematic Friction
Each material interaction has 2 friction coefficients one static ($\mu_s$) and one kinematic ($\mu_d$), the first is to break the stacity and the second to determine the friction force that slows down the motion.

~ Example:
wood on wood: $\mu_s = 0.25 \sim 0.5$,  $\mu_d = 0.2$
glass on glass: $\mu_s = 0.94$,  $\mu_d = 0.4$
sky on dry snow: $\mu_s \simeq 0$,  $\mu_d = 0.04$

When the object is moving and $\mu_s >> \mu_s$ (usually true) we approximate the static friction coefficient $\mu_s$ to 0, so we do not need to calculate it, so $\Omega_d = \tan^{-1}(\mu_d)$
