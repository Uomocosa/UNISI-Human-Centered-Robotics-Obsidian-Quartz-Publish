# Differential Threshold
The *differential threshold* is the smallest difference between two stimuli that can be detected

The differential threshold was defined as the amount of change in a stimulus ($\Delta \Phi$) required to produce a **just noticeable difference (JND)** in the sensation.

When a stimulus above the AT is applied to the sense organ, the intensity of the stimulus must be increased or decreased by some critical amount before a person is able to report any change in sensation.

Applying first a little force (above AT) then just a tiny bit more will result in no change of sensation

Instead if we apply first a force equal or above AT then we add a force equal or above DT we have a change in sensation.

###### ~ Ex.: JND
Intensity stimulus = 10 units
Stimulus must be increased to 12 units to produce a just noticeable increment in the sensation
-> Difference threshold = 2 units
