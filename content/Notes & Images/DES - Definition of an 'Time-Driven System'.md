### Time-Driven System:
In **time-driven** systems, the state changes synchronously with the system clock.

It can be both a [[DES - Definition of 'Dynamical System'|dynamical system]]  or a [[DES - Definition of 'Discrete'|discrete]] one

Continuous-time, continuous-state, time-driven systems are typically modeled by [[Differential Equations|differential equations]]
