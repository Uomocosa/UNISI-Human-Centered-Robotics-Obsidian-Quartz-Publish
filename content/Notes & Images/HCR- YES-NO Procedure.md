# YES-NO Procedure
The yes-no procedure involves the subject judging the presence or absence of the signal.
A stimulus is presented, during which the subject has to make a yes or no response.
Correct responses can range from 0% to 100%.

With this procedure the subject are given a long series of trials, usually more than 300 in a session in which they have to judge the presence or absence of a signal.

###### Problems with this procedure
- This method is influenced greatly from the subject subjective criterion.
- An excellent technique for obtaining a measure of the observer's sensitivity which is uncontaminated by fluctuations in criterion is the forced choice procedure.
