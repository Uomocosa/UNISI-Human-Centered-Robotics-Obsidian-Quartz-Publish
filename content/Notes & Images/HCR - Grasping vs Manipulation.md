# Grasping vs Manipulation:
- **GRASPING**: Holding an object (it moves with me but is relatively still)
- **MANIPULATION**: Hold an object and control its *trajectory* (specific to the object)

We can see:
- Manipulation -> active motion
- Grasping -> passive motion

-> To manipulate objects humans have specifically developed the thumb
- Really important when talking about manipulation.

There are 2 kinds of manipulation:
- [[HCR - IN-HAND MANIPULATION|IN-HAND MANIPULATION]]
- [[HCR - IN-HAND MANIPULATION|POWER GRASP]]

# Brain prospective
From our brain prospective when we grasp an object (power grasp) it does not cast anything (it doesn't think about the hand receptors).
- For power grasping we do have control over the object in our hand, but it is not accurate, tho it is fast to process (for our brain).
- For in-hand manipulation, like writing with a pen we use 3 contact point (more generally a small number of contact points) and we need to control each of them very well.
(While for power grasping we have many contact point but no need to control them)
