Mathematical description of the system:
$$
\overline X(t) = f(X(t),t)
$$
(~ex.: eq. to describe the motion of my shoulder)

$\overline X(t_0)$ := **STATE OF THE SYSTEM**

I can find $\overline X(t_0 + h)$ using the mathematical description of the system

> **NOTE**:
> If i have to describe a system that has only to be seen by a human, my speed (frame rate) has to be above 20 Hz
> If you also have to give the sense of touch it has to increase above 1k Hz
> 
> -> **VISION** $> 20$ Hz
> -> **TOUCH** $> 1k$ Hz
