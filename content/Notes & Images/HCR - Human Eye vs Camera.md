  - Human Eye vs Camera
---
- ***Human Eye***:
	- Retina measures about $5 \times 5$ cm$^2$  and contains $10^8$ sampling elements (roots and cones).
	- Spectral resolution $\sim 0.01$° over a $150$° field of view (NOT evenly distributed)
	- $11$ bit/element, $10$ Hz resolution
	- ==Resulting in a total of $3$ GB/s (considering both eyes)==.
----
- ***Camera***
	- The cameras of today only archive information up to a rate of $12$MB/s (hundreds of times less than the human eye)
	- To get a 3d effect we use 2 cameras (one per eye) which project different 2D images, the brain does the rest:<br>![[Pasted image 20220329100633.png|444]]
