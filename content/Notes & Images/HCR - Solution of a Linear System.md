  - Solution of a Linear System

A liner system can have:
- 0 solutions
- 1 solutions
- $\infty$ solutions

The forces applied by our brain should belong to the friction cones and if I have only 1 solution  for $F_{C1}, \ F_{C2}, \ \ldots, \ F_{Cn}$ no one guaranties me that one specific solution belongs to the friction cones
- It's much better to have **$\infty$ solutions** to respect the **friction constraints**.
