# Psychophysical Measurements
Psychophysical methods and procedures are useful in determining threshold.

For a perfect observer, threshold is the point where the stimulus can just be detected or where you just cannot detect the stimulus.

**Humans are not perfect observers**, and often thresholds are defined in probabilistic terms: for example, half the points presented would be detected and half would not.

**Threshold variability most likely depends on neural noise.**

Measurement of visual response can be achieved through several methods.
