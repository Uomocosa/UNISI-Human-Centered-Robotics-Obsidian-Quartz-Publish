### Time-Driven vs. Event-Driven Systems
- [[DES - Definition of an 'Time-Driven System'|Time-Driven Systems]]
- [[DES - Definition of an 'Event-Driven System'|Event-Driven Systems]]

The principal difference is given by how the **time** is seen, both are dynamical systems but for the time-driven systems, as the name suggest the time is what guides the states of the system and its evolution.
While for the event-driven systems the time is only a variable, what really guides the system are the events, which are typically asynchronous.

Also the time-driven system is usually modeled by [[Differential Equations|differential equations]], instead the event-driven sytem is non-differentiable.
