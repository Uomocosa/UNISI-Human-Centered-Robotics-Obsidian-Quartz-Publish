# Algorithm
Given $x_h$ haptic point (same as $x_a$ just a different name):
$$
x_h = \ <x_{hx}, \ x_{hy}, \ x_{hz}>
$$
the minimum distance from the place $\Sigma$ ($ax + by + cz +d = 0)$ can be computed as the distance of $x_h$ from $x_p$ ($p$: proxy) where $x_p$ is defined as the projection of $x_h$ onto $\Sigma$.
