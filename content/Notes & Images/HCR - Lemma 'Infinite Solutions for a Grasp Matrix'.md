# Infinite Solutions for a Grasp Matrix
Continuing from [[HCR - Theorem 'At Least One Solutions for a Grasp Matrix'|this theorem]] ...
If $\rho(G) = \rho(G \ \vdots \ W_c)$ and:
- $N(G) = \{0\}$ -> $1$ solution
- $N(G) \neq \{0\}$ -> $\infty$ solutions

-> $N(G)$ : **null space** of $G$
> **NOTE**:
> $\{0\}$ is always in the null space.
> $N(G) \neq \{0\}$ means that the null space contains other vectors other than $\{0\}$
