### Dynamical System:
 A system is **dynamical** if the output at time t depends only on the **history** of the input before time t.

 ###### ~Example: the capacitor
$v(t) = v(0) + \frac{1}{C}\int_{0}^{t} i(\tau{}) \,d\tau{}$

 #### Osservation:
 To solve a problem given by a dynamical system is essentially solve a [[Differential Equations|differential equation]], but to know an exact result we need the **initial conditions**, or in case of a system the [[DES - Definition of 'State of a System'|state of the system]]
