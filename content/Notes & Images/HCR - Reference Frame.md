# Reference Frame
The reference frame is a 3 axis system that are usually connected by a body, an object or a system that can be used to acquire information or transmit information.
For example a camera can be a reference frame, when you record a video, you are recording from a fixed point of view, the lenses of the camera, which has a **mean direction**.
We can use the object frame (the camera) as reference for a robotic arm that gets information from it, so the camera becomes our **reference frame**.

Main concepts:
- **Reference Frame**.
- **Position**.
- **Orientation**.

###### Reference Frames Examples:
1. Camera Reference Frame
2. Multi joint hand fingertips frame
3. Virtual world reference frame

Everything has a reference frame in our robotic task.
> **Main task in robotics**: 
> Represent a reference frame of an object into another object's reference frame, that can be the world reference frame, the camera's, sensor's, ...
