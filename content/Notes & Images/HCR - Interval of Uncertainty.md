The range on the stimulus dimension over which an observer cannot perceive a difference between the comparison and the standard stimuli is called the interval of uncertainty (IU) and is computed by subtracting the mean lower limen (Ll) from the mean upper limen (Lu)
- The Lu and Ll are calculated using the [[HCR - Method of Limits|ascending and descending limits]].
