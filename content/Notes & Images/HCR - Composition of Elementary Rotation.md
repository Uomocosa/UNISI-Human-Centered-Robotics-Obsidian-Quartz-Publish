# Composition of Elementary Rotation
Each [[HCR - Pose of a Rigid Body|orientation]] could be composed by elementary rotations of the object frame with respect to the [[HCR - Reference Frame|reference frame]].

Successive rotations of an object about the **object frame** is obtained by **Premultiplication** of rotation matrices.

Successive rotations of an object about the **reference frame** is obtained by **Postmultiplication** of rotation matrices.

Where Premultiplication and Postmultiplication only mean *when* the Elementary Rotation Matrix is multiplied (if at the *beginning* or at the *end*).

> **NOTE**:
> The object frame is referenced to the reference frame

The composition of various Elementary Rotation Matrix gives form to a complete [[HCR - Rotation Matrix|Rotation Matrix]]

We need also to define **how** the elementary rotation are composed, to do this we use the [[HCR - Rotation Matrices Descriptors|rotation matrix descriptors]].
