# Conclusion
So we desire for a grasp matrix such that:
$$
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\rho(G) = \rho(G \ \vdots \ W_c)
\\
N(G) \neq \{0\}
\end{array}
\right.
$$
-> Then we will have $\infty$ solutions for the forces applied at the contact points ($\overline{\overline{F_c}} = F_{C1}, \ F_{C2}, \ \ldots, \ F_{Cn}$).
- Among all the solutions we can find one that satisfies the **friction constraints**.
