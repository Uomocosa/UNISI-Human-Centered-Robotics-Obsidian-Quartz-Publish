### Discrete:
Somenthing discrete means somenthing defined only for a **set of points**, of course, this set can be infinite.

But a discrete function **cannot be** continuos, so it also can't be differentiable

###### ~Example:
When you hear the word **discrete** think of the definition of time $t$ in a set like the natural numbers: $\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, ...\}$.
