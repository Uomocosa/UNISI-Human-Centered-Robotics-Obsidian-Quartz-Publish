# Triangular Meshes

We can create a plane with 3 points (~ex.: $T_1$: triangle 1, formed by $x_1,\  x_2, \ x_3$)
- So given the triangle $T_1$ we can use the previous formula to calculate the minimum distance $x_h$ from $T_1$.

So I can receive an haptic feedback proportional to the distance $\overline{x_h \ x_p}$ 
- For a smooth object there are no problem with this approach.
