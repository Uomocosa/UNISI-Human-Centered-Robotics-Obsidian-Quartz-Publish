  - Theorem 'At Least One Solutions for a Grasp Matrix'
---
We have that the [[HCR - Grasp Matrix â€¢ Matrice di Grasp|grasp matrix]] $\left(\bar{\bar{G}}\right)$:$$\overrightarrow{W_c} = \overline{\overline{G}} \cdot \overline{\overline{F_c}}$$==Will accepts $1$ or [[HCR - Lemma 'Infinite Solutions for a Grasp Matrix'|infinite]] solutions if and only if $\rho(G) = \rho(G \ \vdots \ W_c)$, otherwise it accepts **no solutions**==.
Where:
- $\rho(G)$: **rank** of matrix $G$
- $\rho(G \ \vdots \ W_c)$: rank of matrix $[G \ \vdots \ W_c]$
- $\rho(G) = \rho(G \ \vdots \ W_c)$  means that $G$ has to have maximum rank.
