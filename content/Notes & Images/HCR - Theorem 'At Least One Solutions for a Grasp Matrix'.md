# At Least One Solutions for a Grasp Matrix
$\overrightarrow{W_c} = \overline{\overline{G}} \cdot \overline{\overline{F_c}}$ accepts $1$ or $\infty$ solutions if and only if $\rho(G) = \rho(G \ \vdots \ W_c)$ 
Else it accepts no solutions.

-> $\rho(G)$: **rank** of matrix $G$
-> $\rho(G \ \vdots \ W_c)$: rank of matrix $[G \ \vdots \ W_c]$
-> $\rho(G) = \rho(G \ \vdots \ W_c)$  means that $G$ has to have maximum rank.
