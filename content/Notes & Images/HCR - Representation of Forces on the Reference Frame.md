  - Representation of the force on the Reference Frame
---
Every force on an object can be represented in the object **RF** (Reference Frame) usually defined as its *barycenter* by another Force plus a Torque.

Also every interaction the object has with the world can be summarized by an external Force and an external Moment (or Torque)

- To compute the Torque $\tau '$

in the RF (reference frame) $0$ ->
$$
\left(
\begin{array}{l}
M_{x_0}
\\
M_{y_0}
\\
M_{z_0}
\end{array}
\right)_0
= 
\overrightarrow{b}_{\ 0} \wedge \overrightarrow{F}_{\ 0}
$$
- The vector product can be computed using the **Skew Matrix**:
