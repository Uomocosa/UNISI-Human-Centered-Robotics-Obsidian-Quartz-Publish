Relation between the differential threshold for intensity and the intensity level of the stimulus:

~ Ex.: DT : 2 units with intensity level of the stimulus = 10 units

What happens when the intensity level of the stimulus is 20, 30, 50, ...?

Below is a plot of some hypothetical data showing Weber's Law.
The slope of the line is the Weber Fraction:<br>![[Pasted image 20220304161205.png|333]]

Whether the stimulus is applied to eye, skin, nose, tongue or other senses there is a lawful relationship between the size of the difference threshold and the stimulus intensity level.

Valid for a range of stimulus intensities, it's a good baseline to compere performance.

But it's not always true â‡’ increase greatly at extremely low stimulus intensities.
