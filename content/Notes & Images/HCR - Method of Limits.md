The method of limits is perhaps the most frequently used technique for determining sensory threshold.

The method is less precise than the [[HCR - Methods of Constant Stimuli|method of constant stimuli]] but is far less time consuming and is therefore used much more extensively.

When we have to choose the values for applying the **method of constant stimuli**, the few minutes taken to estimate the location of the threshold would be well spent by this method.

The experiments starts by presenting a stimulus well above or well below threshold; on each successive presentation, the threshold is approached by changing the stimulus intensity by a small amount until the boundary of sensation is reached.

The stimuli are manipulated in either an **ascending series** or a **descending series**.

- If the series is **ascending** we start with a weak stimuli and increase it until the observer reports its presence, the experiment is stopped.
- Instead if the series is **descending** we start with the presence of the stimuli and decrease it until the observer cannot perceive it anymore.

These two type of experiments are called respectively:
- **Ascending limit**
- **Descending limit**

----
- ***Error of Habituation***
	- Making the same response also when the threshold is reached.
	- Can be reduced with clear instruction, demonstration and practice runs.7
----
- ***Error of Expectation***
	- May anticipate the arrival of the stimulus.
	- Can be reduced by changing series and starting intensity.
