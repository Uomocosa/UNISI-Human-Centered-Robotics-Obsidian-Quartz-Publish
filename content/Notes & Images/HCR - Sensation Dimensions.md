# Sensation Dimensions
Intensity isn't the only way in which sensation can differ.
Sensation can differ an at least four basic dimensions:
- **Intensity**
- **Quality**
- **Extension**
- **Duration**


By varying along the dimension of extension, the DT ([[HCR - Definition of 'Differential Threshold'|Differential Threshold]]) can be measured for variation in spatial aspect of the physical such as:
- **Size**
- **Location**
- **Separation**
- **Duration**
