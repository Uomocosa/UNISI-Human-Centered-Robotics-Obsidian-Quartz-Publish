###### Exercise 1:
Compute the [[HCR - Grasp Matrix|Grasp Matrix]] in the object frame for the following grasps.
Give the dimension of the Jacobian Matrix.

For a general grasp (not the one in the figure) write the main equations of the grasp an in your words describe the sequence of operations that you have to follow to apply a given wrench $W_c$ through the contact force.
How do you compute the contact force?
What's the role of the nullspace of the grasp matrix?

###### Exercise 2:
Describe in your words the role of the [[HCR - Direct Kinematics|Direct Kinematics]] and of the Jacobian in computer haptic.
In other terms describe in your words how a robot can play a role of [[HCR - Haptic Display|Haptic Display]]

###### Exercise 3:
Describe the process (or algorithm) of triangulation to compute the normal for the haptic feedback in a triangle of a triangular mesh.
