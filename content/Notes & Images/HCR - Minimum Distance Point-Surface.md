It's easy to know if you are "in" or "out" of a single **plane**
- Knowing your position $\bar x_a$ ($a$: avatar) or $\bar x_h$ ($h$: haptic point), and the formula of the plane: $ax + by+ cz +d$ we can calculate:
$$
ax_{ax} + bx_{ay}+ cx_{az} +d
$$
and define as "in" if the result is $\lt 0$ or "out" if the result is $\gt 0$.
