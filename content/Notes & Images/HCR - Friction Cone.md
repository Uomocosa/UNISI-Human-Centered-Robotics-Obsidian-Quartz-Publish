# Friction Cone
==A way to visualize **friction**==

The friction cone depends on the $F_D$ (Force Down-ward) and $\mu$ the friction coefficient.

-> Where:
$$
\begin{array}{l}
\Theta = 
\\
\eta: \text{friction coefficent}
\end{array}
$$
(The friction coefficent ($\eta$) is specific for each pair of object interaction)

- A force that want to break the friction is applied as shown:

$F_1$ is too small to break friction (the object doesn't move)
$F_2$ is big enough (the object begins to move)
- Graphically $F_1$ is **inside the friction cone**
- While $F_2$ is **outside the friction cone**

Knowing **where** the friction cone is, and how **big** it is, is extremely crucial, because if i want to apply force to the object without it slipping out (break friction) i need to apply all the forces such that they stay **inside** the friction cones.

###### ~ Ex.: Position of the friction cones
Suppose we have this object:

Let's see how the position of the friction cones is useful.

I apply to the previous object 3 forces: $F_1, F_2, F_3$, resulting in this 3 friction cones:

Take now an opposite force $F$ that tries to break friction.
It is clear that where i apply the previous 3 forces changes the intensity of the Force $F$ needed to break friction:
