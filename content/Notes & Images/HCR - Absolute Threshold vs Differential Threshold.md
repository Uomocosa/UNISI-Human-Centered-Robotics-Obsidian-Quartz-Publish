# AT vs DT
The concept of sensory noise provides a principle for understanding absolute and differential threshold:

*[[HCR - Definition of 'Absolute Threshold'|ABSOLUTE THRESHOLD]]*:
- Value of the stimulus intensity needed to increase the neural activity above the sensory noise level by some critical amount.

*[[HCR - Definition of 'Differential Threshold'|DIFFERENTIAL THRESHOLD]]*:
- Change in the stimulus intensity needed to produce a critical difference in neural activity level associated with two intensity of stimulation.
