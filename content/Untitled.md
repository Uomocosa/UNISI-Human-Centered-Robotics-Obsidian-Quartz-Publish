- Given a triangular mesh of an object, we need first to identify the **bounding box**, so the smallest box that contains the triangle we want to 'study':<br>So we start by checking it the **end-effector** represented by an avatar vector $x_h$ is inside or outside the "starting box", if it is outside, then we are certain that there is no contact, otherwise if $x_h$ is inside the bounding box, we consider a more restrictive (a smaller) box, and check again, we continue to shrink and check this way untill we find that: $x_h$ is not inside the current bounding box, so the end effector does not touch the object, or we have reached the minum bounding box.<br>Also we can calculate the minum distance between $x_h$ and $x_p$ (a point of the triangle/plane):<br>***1.*** We start by defining the plane we are working with, with its coefficients:<br>$(a \ b \ c)$ and $d$, such that:$$(a \ b \ c)\cdot x_p = d$$***2.*** Then we find $x_p$ such that the distance between $x_p$ and $x_h$ is minimum so:$$x_p : \min\left(\sqrt{(x_p - x_h)^{\tiny T}(x_p - x_h)}\right)$$***3.*** Then using the distance $D = \overline{x_h \kern5px x_p}$, we can say that if $D \gt 0$ then the **end-effector** does not touch the plane, $D \lt 0$ the **end-effector** is "inside"/is touching the object.<br>***4.*** We can use the value of the distance $D$ as a way to give a proper response to the user, like changin the output force of the manipualtor if we have an higher value $D$.
